GOOGLE_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash

TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key

LANGSMITH_TRACING=false
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=MyGPT
```

If you do not want to use LangSmith tracing, keep:

```env
LANGSMITH_TRACING=false
```

---

## Run Locally

Start the FastAPI app:

```bash
python app.py

## Docker Deployment

### 1. Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t MyGPT .
```

### 2. Run the Docker container

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name MyGPT \
  --restart always \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --env-file .env \
  MyGPT
```

The app will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

## AWS CI/CD Deployment with GitHub Actions

This project can be deployed to AWS using:

* GitHub Actions
* Amazon ECR
* Amazon EC2
* Docker
* GitHub self-hosted runner

---

### 1. Create an IAM User

Create an IAM user for deployment and attach the following policies:

```text
AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess
AmazonEC2FullAccess
```

You can also use a more restricted custom IAM policy for production.

---

### 2. Create an ECR Repository

Create an Amazon ECR repository.

Example full ECR image URI:

```text
315865595366.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/MyGPT
```

For GitHub Secrets, only save the repository name:

```text
ECR_REPO=MyGPT
```

Do not save the full ECR URI as `ECR_REPO`.

---

### 3. Create an EC2 Instance

Create an Ubuntu EC2 instance.

Recommended inbound security group rule:

```text
Type: Custom TCP
Port: 8080
Source: 0.0.0.0/0
```

---

### 4. Install Docker on EC2

Connect to your EC2 instance and run:

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

Install Docker:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

Add the Ubuntu user to the Docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
newgrp docker
```

Check Docker:

```bash
docker --version
```

---

### 5. Configure EC2 as a GitHub Self-Hosted Runner

Go to your GitHub repository:

```text
Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner
```

Select Linux and follow the commands shown by GitHub.

After setup, start the runner:

```bash
./run.sh
```

For production, you can configure the runner as a service:

```bash
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
```

---

## GitHub Secrets

Add the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

```text
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
ECR_REPO

GOOGLE_API_KEY
GOOGLE_MODEL
TAVILY_API_KEY
LANGSMITH_TRACING
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT
LANGSMITH_API_KEY
LANGSMITH_PROJECT
```

Path:

```text
GitHub Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
```

Example:

```text
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
ECR_REPO=MyGPT
GOOGLE_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=MyGPT
```

---

## GitHub Actions Workflow

Create this file:

```text
.github/workflows/cicd.yaml
```

This workflow will:

1. Build your Docker image
2. Push the image to Amazon ECR
3. Pull the latest image on EC2
4. Stop the old container
5. Run the new container

---

## Usage

After running locally or deploying to AWS:

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Start chatting with the AI assistant.
3. Upload documents to use them as context.
4. Ask questions about uploaded files.
5. Ask current-information questions to trigger web search.
6. Continue conversations with saved chat history.

---

## Example Questions

```text
Summarize the uploaded PDF.
```

```text
Search the web for the latest AI agent news.
```

```text
Based on my uploaded document, what are the key points?
```

```text
Calculate 125 * 48 / 6.
```

---

## Notes

* Do not commit your `.env` file to GitHub.
* Keep API keys inside GitHub Secrets for deployment.
* For production, avoid using `reload=True` in Uvicorn.
* Make sure port `8080` is open in your EC2 security group.
* Rotate any API keys that were accidentally exposed publicly.
